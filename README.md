# bsh-shell-program
This is a project done in the Operating Systems course at my college. This project is about implementing a shell program similar to the known shell programs sh or bash. The program is written in C. I implemented a few built-in commands that operate in a similar way with those known shell programs. I developed the following commands:
* exit
* env
* setenv
* unsetenv
* cd
* history
* ls  
The code contains comments and printed messages as needed.
